## Technical Implementation

### Data Fetching
```typescript
// Fetch forms data for statistics
const { data: formsData } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ["forms", college?.id],
  queryFn: () => FormService.getFormsWithFields({ collegeId: college?.id }),
  enabled: !!college?.id,
})
```

### State Management
```typescript
const [isCreateFormOpen, setIsCreateFormOpen] = useState(false)
```

### Query Invalidation
```typescript
onSuccess={() => {
  queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ["college", slug] })
  queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ["forms", college?.id] })
  setIsCreateFormOpen(false)
}}
```
