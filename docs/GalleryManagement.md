# Gallery Management System

## Overview

The Gallery Management System allows college administrators to create and manage gallery events with multiple images. Each event can have multiple images, and each image can have a description.

## Data Structure

The gallery data is stored as JSON in the `galleryImages` field of the College model:

```json
{
  "events": [
    {
      "eventName": "Opening Ceremony",
      "eventDate": "2025-05-10",
      "description": "The official opening ceremony of the college with speeches and performances.",
      "images": [
        {
          "url": "https://res.cloudinary.com/.../opening1.jpg",
          "description": "Dean giving the welcome speech."
        },
        {
          "url": "https://res.cloudinary.com/.../opening2.jpg",
          "description": "Students performing the national anthem."
        }
      ]
    }

## API Integration

### Upload Service
The system uses Cloudinary for image storage:

```typescript
// Upload an image
const response = await uploadService.uploadImage(file, `colleges/${college.slug}/gallery`)
```

### College Service
Gallery data is saved as part of the college update:

```typescript
// Save gallery data
await CollegeService.updateCollege(college.id, {
  ...college,
  galleryImages: galleryData
})
```

## Styling

The gallery system uses Tailwind CSS with custom components:

- **Cards**: For event containers
- **Grid**: For image layouts
- **Hover effects**: For interactive elements
- **Responsive design**: Works on all screen sizes
